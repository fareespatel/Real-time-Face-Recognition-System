# Real-time-Face-Recognition-System
Python code for implementing a real time face recognition system

In this project, I attempted to detect faces in a digital image using various techniques such as Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant (FLD), Eigen-face decomposition, and LBPH (Local binary patterns histograms).
